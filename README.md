# Syntecxhub_password_manager
Build a local password manager that stores credentials encrypted on disk. Use strong symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) and secure key handling. Implement add, retrieve, delete, and search password entries. Include a master password + secure local storage format (e.g., encrypted JSON).
